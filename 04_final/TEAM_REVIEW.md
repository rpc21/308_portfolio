CompSci 308: Team Review

## Team ByteMe!
 
### Team Work Environment

I thought the team work environment was mostly effective.  We had been planning our team for most of the semester so 
by the time we got to the final project we had a team of people that we had already built trust and respect for. 
There were a couple interpersonal conflicts and I could feel that there was some resentment building up between two 
parts of the team but I feel that everyone did a good job remaining mature and professional throughout the project 
and realized that we were all on the same team and had the same goals.

#### What were your team's goals for the project and do you think they were clear to everyone?
The team's goals for this project was to make the best project we could, as pleasantly as possible. One of our team 
goals was to make this as an enjoyable experience as possible for all the members on the team by making sure we only 
had people that were committed and wanting to work hard so nobody had to carry the team. In terms of the design of 
the project we wanted the design to be as flexible as possible, giving the user the most control they could possibly 
have over the game. I think the goals of the project were clear to everyone.

#### How was work divided among the team members and do you think everyone was clear about their responsibilities?
Hsing, Dima, Lucas, and Feroze worked on the engine. Harry, Carrie, and Anna worked on the authoring environment. 
Megan was in charge of the game center. Louis was in charge of the game runner. I was in charge of the data. I think 
there were definitely some miscommunications about responsibilities throughout the project.  I think moste people 
were under the assumption that engine was going to have a much bigger role than it actually did in the project and 
that is why engine needed so many people, when in reality it seemed that a lot of work people thought would be done 
by engine ultimately fell on the authoring environment which was frustrating for a lot of people. Additionally, I am 
not sure that the game center or runner had super clear expectations but I think that is more because people wanted 
them to have the freedom to do whatever they wanted with those parts of the project.

#### How was the communication within the team (was it too much, too little, just right) and why?
I felt the communication was just right. Teammates were very responsive throughout the project and we had great 
attendance at our meetings throughout. You could always get an update on where different parts of the project were if
 you wanted.

#### How was clear was the work flow of committing code and how easy did it make sharing progress and why?
The work flow of committing was very different among the various sub teams. Engine would commit every small little 
change which was very different from some members work flows where they would wait a long time and then make a big 
commit when everything was ready. Both these strategies had pros and cons. The engine work flow was nice because you 
always had the most up to date engine but it would often have bugs. The other options would be frustrating because 
you wouldn't really know what was going on most of the time but when commits did happen they would make huge steps 
forward which was exciting.

### Rate Your Teammates

#### For each team mate, provide a justification for your evaluation

Everyone on this team was great to work with and poured their heart and soul into this project and deserves a great 
rating. I rated how I rated to show some spread but I honestly thing everyone did a great job and I am very thankful 
to have gotten to work with these nine people.

hgr8 - Was always willing to help people out with their questions. Coached the entire front end part of the team on 
CSS so we could integrate it effectively into our project and make it look uniform. Would consistently go above and 
beyond such as when he made our complex game for the demo and would do the technical run through for the demo.

mep76 - Was the organizational back bone of our team, always holding team members accountable and would make sure 
that we would meet all our deadlines and have our documents submitted properly (refactoring lab, demo games video, 
plan documents, etc). One of the two people I would most want to work with again.

clh87 - Steadying force on the team and always willing to help out others. Helped each person individually make their
games in the authoring environment. Very steady work ethic with constant improvements and bug fixes showing a 
consistent workflow. One of the two people I would most want to work with again.

ard51 - Incredibly hard worker, took on many parts of the projects (launcher and authoring) and was always willing to
compromise with others to make things easier for them. On multiple occasions decided it would be easier to just redo
their part of the project instead of working to a better solution to fit with engine. This could be taken as 
willing to compromise or indicative of inflexible code or lack of communication.

ht114 - Constantly available, willing to meet, willing to compromise and willing to help. A clear leader on the 
engine team and would most effectively communicate with other parts of the project. A joy to work with. Implemented 
complex systems that basically made the whole engine work. Implemented the garbage collection in the engine that made
our engine lag much less than other teams we saw. Wrote tests for all of her code which inspired other team members 
to do the same.

fm87 - Unsure about most of his responsibilities throughout the project so can't give a certain rating, but he made a
very cool guitar hero game that really added to our demo and showed off the flexibility of our design. Seemed 
somewhat confused early on in the project when we were asking him about code he wrote involving complex stream 
operations that were incredibly difficult to debug due to their complexity and lack of readability. Would sometimes 
be unfocused on the goals of the whole team and more focused just on the game he was making. Left our final meeting 
before the code freeze to watch Game of Thrones for two hours which rubbed some people the wrong way.
 
dkf8 - Not enough information to rate 

lbj7 - Very calming presence on the team. Missed three team meetings due to travel which is not his fault of course 
but nobody else missed any team meetings. Did not implement a couple features we were expecting such as saving scores
or checkpoints despite the functionality to support it being there in other parts of the project.
 
ltl9 - Seemed to be the driving force of engine pushing their responsibilities on to authoring which was the biggest 
source of conflict on our team. Viewed himself as a 
leader or above others which was frustrating for many members of our team. Heard several complaints from other 
teammates that this person would talk down to them. Would occasionally directly edit master in gitlab instead of 
properly using branches and making a merge request as we had agreed in our team contract.


## Personal

### My Rating

I would give myself a 4. I would consistently meet my deadlines with plenty of time, including not pushing any more 
code in the last 12 hours of the project to make sure my part was stable while my teammates were trying to use it to 
add the finishing touches to their parts of the project. Did most of the database management for the team including 
setting up the database and loading any images, bios, sounds etc members wanted to test before authoring was ready to
let people to use them. Would document my processes throughout the project and send step-by-step setup instructions 
(with annotated pictures) to my teammates to help them set up and integrate my parts of the project with theirs. I 
would also organize, along with Megan many of our team meetings by helping to find a time for everyone to get 
together and forming an agenda of the most pressing full team issues. I was always willing to help out others with 
their parts of the project and consistently got feedback of "wow that was really easy!" and "that's all I have to 
do?" when I would meet with other team members to integrate my part with theirs. I also felt like I was an 
approachable person my teammates could come to to express their frustrations with other team members or parts of the
project and I would always listen and when appropriate, help to try to resolve the conflicts which I think was 
appreciated by my team members.

### My Role on the Team

My primary role on the team was to handle the data portion of the project and set up and maintain the database that 
our team used for the project. I also helped out in small ways with Game Center, giving design input and adding a 
couple features such as the ability to change profile pictures. On the non technical side of the project, I would also
organize, along with Megan many of our team meetings by helping to find a time for everyone to get together and 
forming an agenda of the most pressing full team issues. I also felt like I was an approachable person my teammates
could come to to express their frustrations with other team members or parts of the
project and I would always listen and when appropriate, help to try to resolve the conflicts which I think was 
appreciated by my team members.

## Summary

### My biggest strength as a team member

My biggest strength as a team member was my approachability for people coming to me with various issues either in 
their code or with other members of our team. Several team members felt comfortable coming to me to express 
frustrations they had with other people on our team which leads me to think that I was a trusted and calming person 
on our team and seen as someone who could help the team come together. On multiple occasions team members would also 
bring me code completely unrelated to my part of the project that they wanted a second opinion on or suggestions on 
how to improve it which makes me think my opinion on coding and design was also valued and a strength of mine.

### My biggest weakness as a team member

My biggest weakness was in my commit patterns. I did not merge my code to master very often at the beginning of the 
project because it was so tied to other peoples parts of the project that I was so scared of breaking things that I 
wouldn't commit as early as I perhaps should have and would not commit until I was certain it would actually work 
which slowed down the development of my part of the project.

### How I improved as a team mate this semester
Over the semester I improved at communicating through code. I got a much better understanding of APIs and how my part
 of the project affects other parts of the project and how to use annotations, comments, commit messages, 
 documentation, face to face communication and interfaces to best help integrate my part of the projects with my 
 teammates without them having to make sweeping changes to their code and allowing them to change their code (if 
 necessary) at their own pace.
